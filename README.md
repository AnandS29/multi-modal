# multi-modal

This repository contains simulation code for the paper [Multi-Modal Paired
Exchange](https://anands29.github.io/assets/pdfs/multi-modal.pdf) by [Anand
Siththaranjan](https://anands29.github.io/).

The necessary packages are in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, which you may want to do within a virtual
environment with a package manager like Anaconda.

To run simulations and generate figure/latex tables, run through the Jupyter notebook `simulation.ipynb`.
